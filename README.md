# Invoice-Processor-by-Doc-AI
Company Project: Invoice Processor  The Invoice Processor is a Python script developed as part of a company project to streamline invoice handling tasks. Leveraging Doc AI, this tool automates the extraction of billing details from receipts, aiming to minimize manual effort and mitigate human error in data entry processes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the Invoice Processor streamlines the extraction of crucial billing information from various types of receipts.

# Tools-and-Technologies:
The Invoice Processor utilizes the following tools and technologies:
● Python programming language for script development.
● Doc AI for receipt processing and data extraction.
● Pandas library for data manipulation.
● NumPy library for numerical computations.
● Matplotlib library for data visualization.
● These technologies were chosen for their efficiency, reliability, and compatibility with the requirements of the project. 

# Description 
The Invoice Processor works by taking input images of receipts and processing them through the Doc AI API. The API employs advanced machine learning models to identify and extract key billing details such as invoice number, date, total amount, and itemized charges. The extracted data is then formatted and stored in a structured format for further analysis or integration with other systems. The script includes error handling mechanisms to address cases where the receipt images are of poor quality or contain ambiguous information.
